# Common Emmiter Amplfier Circuits



The common emitter amplifier accepts AC signal inputs and amplifies the entire AC input signal. \
For this circuit to work however, the common emitter amplifier requires biasing to operate between the minimum and maximum peak values on the input signal. \
It is also necessary to keep the transistor operating in active mode. \
In amplifier design, minimizing distortion is a major issue. The Q-point or quiescent operating point of an amplifier is the DC operating current or voltage at the transistor with no input signal supplied. \
The Q-point for a transistor is typically half of the supply. \

Voltage Divider Biasing
To achieve correct biasing, R1 and R2 must be chosen to maintain the base voltage at the transistor at a constant level. The base voltage VB is a function of the supply voltage and the two resistors at the base of the transistor.

Once the amplifier is properly biased, the voltage gain calculation is shown below. \
An important note is that the gain of the circuit is different for low frequencies than it is for high frequencies and the gain is then a function of the load resistance and the internal resistance of the transistor. \
Coupling capacitors C1 and C2 are used to separate the AC input signal from the DC biasing voltage.
